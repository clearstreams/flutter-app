## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

<!--
```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
flutter run

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
flutter run

```
